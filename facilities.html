        <p>In the session 2015-2016, “Colonels Academy” has connected with “NIIT”. Since, the scenario of both teaching and learning keeps on changing by the day, NIIT came ahead and programmed its own software, which is completely based on the digital way of teaching- learning. The school has adopted their technology.</p>


        <p>The advantage of using this offline application package is that, it allows us to use real-time application oriented software. e.g GIMP, Picasa, JAVA, Pivot Animator, Sketch up make and many more. The most interesting feature about this software package is, at the same time, it gives us opportunity to learn the theory part of the related topic and to apply the same on computer, which enhances the technical skill of each and every student.</p>

        <p>NIIT provides each student a learning certificate at the end of the session, which will be completely based upon the performance of the student.</p>

        <p><b>ERP</b> : Enterprise Resource Planning has been installed in the school office; all office records are maintained and monitored through this system.</p>

        <p><b>Smart Class</b> : Extra marks Education India(P) Ltd. has equipped the smart classes which are regularly maintained and updated by them..............</p>
